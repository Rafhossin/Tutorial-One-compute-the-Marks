# Tutorial-One-compute-the-Marks
A program to compute the average of a set of marks
 The user will insert 6 marks from the keyboard. Save these marks in an array of integers and print them back on the screen.) 
 Print how many marks are below 40 (Fail)
Print how many marks are from 40 to 49 (Pass) Print how many marks are from 50 to 59 (2:2)
Print how many marks are from 60 to 69 (2:1)
Print how many marks are equal or above 70 (First)
A method that compute the average among the six marks.
The method takes as parameter an array of integers and return the average as a double.
From the main method call this method passing the array with your six marks and print on the screen the output.
A method that compute the maximum mark among those saved in the array and print it on the screen. The method takes as parameter an array of integers and return an int.
A method that compute the minimum mark among those saved in the array and print it on the screen The method takes as parameter an array of integers and return an int.
A method that sort the marks in the array in ascending order (from the smallest to the largest). The method takes as parameter an array of integers and return an array of integers.
